For the implementation of education this 2nd semester, all is in fairness, I can say. Student organizations are there for extracurricular matters. Education quality is fair. I would like to raise a concern regarding scholarship matters. It was said that all Student Financial Aid Grantees (SFAG) are required to attend all events organized by Circle of Student Assistants. This includes fundraising. However, I find it concerning. Kaya nga po nag-apply sa scholarship kasi may ibang students na hindi afford bumili sa fundraising, tapos malalaman po namin na required lahat ng grantee na mag-purchase in order to acquire certificate of participation. Those certificates of participation (in any events of CoSA) will be evaluated by the scholarship office at the end of the semester to see if deserving pa ba sa scholarship grant. I find it concerning po na sinasabi ng CoSA na required lahat attendan, and if not, ay walang certificate of participation na ibibigay. Paano po kapag hindi physically/mentally able to attend other events? Sobrang pressing lang po on my end. I know po na may kapalit yung scholarship na binibigay sa amin pero sana naman po ay hindi sapilitan ang mangyari. All in all for DLSU-D this 2nd sem, I would rate as 6/10.","I would like to suggest po sa CoSA not to require all grantees to attend events, lalo na po yung other students na may mas need talaga attendan. Also I would suggest that they just equalize giving duty hours for grantees depending on the percentage of their grant. Example: 50% grantees = 90 hours. 25% grantees = 50 hours. 10% grantees = 30 hours. That will then be the basis of their participation as student assistants, hindi po yung sapilitan sa mga grantees na umattend sa events though isa po yong way to gather the members of the organization. As for the comments on DLSUD, the environment is amazing, yung lake lang po sana ay mabigyan ng attention since isa po yon sa mga large attraction for new students. Also sana rin po ay madagdagan ang wifi hotspots like sa grandstand and botanical garden for students who opt to study/stay there. Lastly po, for RSOs, sana po ay mapaglaanan sila ng respective offices. Marami nga pong organization sa university, but where to properly cater them?

Luckily for me, some of my professors are outstanding at teaching and they provide a digestible, yet college level understanding of the subject being tackled at hand, and they give a reasonable amount of enabling assessments/activities. However, some professors failed to consider the evolving way of teaching and giving out activities. Each subject, especially General Education (minor) subjects, either gives at least 3 activities/assessments per week or 1 very heavy activity/assessment per week. If my calculations are right, we have to accomplish at least 100 or more online activities/assessments before midterms ends. This gives us no time to actually study our specialized and major subjects, read more material for a quiz or test, and/or even perform our basic tasks as members of the household. And as for faculty members, some professors does not know how to teach at all. Some faculty members dismiss the plea and cry of students just so they can maintain their position. Lastly, the student services are great in terms of giving support to students. However, they become bothersome when they make their services and events a ""requirement"". Student services tell students that their services is not mandatory and students have the freedom to disengage in said activities yet it is part of their grades/performance in the university.","I suggest hiring future faculty members that values the passion of teaching, and not just because of their achievements in their resume. Get more Equipment on needed matters and listen to what the students are saying, rather than dismissing them. They know better what the university needs because they are the ones using and learning from this institution. Lessening of unimportant and outdated activities in order to focus on what the students wants to further study about. Re-evaluate faculty members, as some faculty members do not have the capacity to either teach, give respect to their student's ideas, sexuality or beliefs or tend to have hatred on the Lasallian community for having such privilege of leaning in an institution they are teaching at.",-1.0

First is my experience as a DLSU-D Student, first I find my peers and other fellow students to be friendly and communicative. As someone who rarely talks, I am really thankful for the accepting nature that fellow students usually bring out. It signified that anyone here who adheres to the Lasallian core values is ACCEPTED. Now, evaluating one of the most imperative missions and goals by De La Salle - University Dasmariñas which is aiming to bring quality education to its students, personally, I find my reading materials and content to be accessible and somewhat student-friendly. As someone studying a pre-law course, I am somewhat contented with the quality of education and learning techniques that my professors bring to the table and I can say that I can keep up with it. If I were to provide such negative comment towards the academic sector, it would the inconsistencies that I found on the provisions of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR). Not to mention, some egoistic professors who disregard providing quality education to prioritize self-reading as I find it to be problematic especially those who are academically-challenged. No one thinks the same, and definitely not everyone has the same talents as other people. As for the facilities, the more I venture as a member of a student council, the more I become disappointed with the facilities that we have in this school. I found some regulations to be completely unnecessary as some facilities may require monetary value in which is contrary in the first place as we, students, were the ones who paid for their maintenance through our tuition fees. Moreover, I am completely underwhelmed with the University's response to student's concerns. For a school that is enjoying the title of being ""One of the best universities in Cavite"", I'm completely underwhelmed with the quality of chairs, restrooms, and other learning materials and appliances as most of them were either damaged or just lacking as a whole. Lastly, on the part of DLSU-D's Office of Student Services, there are offices in which I did not have any experience with it at all. However, if I were to mention a few, it would be the SCW and SWAFO. First is the SCW in which I surely appreciate what they do to my peers and mostly students who are in need of help. In a blended setting like today, we cannot deny that what they do is not an easy task which is why I'm truly appreciative when it comes to them. As for the SWAFO, I'm truly dumbfounded with some of their statutes and provisions. Not to mention their arrogant behavior towards students in which some scenarios do not even have the right logic in the first place. For an office that aimed to ""discipline"" and provide ""positive change"" to students, they only managed to tarnish their own reputation.  ","With that being said, I'd just wish the University would be more mindful of every student's concerns. The problem I see mostly in this University are that the higher-ups take criticisms not as a way to improve but rather as an insult. With this, if the University would want to create a student-friendly environment, they must of course consider students as valuable respondents and evaluators. PS: The restrooms at JFH are honestly underwhelming + the bidet doesn't even work. :(",-1.0

First, the facilities in the west campus are kind of forgotten especially in MTH. The classrooms and restrooms are derelict. Second, the implementation of the student's week last March could've been better. I think it would be better if it was conducted after exams such as midterms or final exams so students don't have to worry about their classes and actually enjoy the student's week. Last student's week, we still had to worry about our classes even if some of the classes the students were supposedly excused from. We had to catch up the week after that and it was fatiguing. It was kind of ironic that way and I believe the student's week would be more rewarding and appreciated if conducted after major exams or whatnot.","For my first concern, I would suggest maintaining, if not improving, the facilities in the west campus.

Gawing practical and real life based ang approach ng syllubus (CSIT). Mag-offer ng mga libreng certification para sa mga prof at students.",-1.0

One even gave an EA during exam week. There is also one professor who makes ""magic magic"" with our grades during the 1st semester. Just recently, he made the other set of our class the audience to his fellow architect; the meeting was indicated with ""synch discussion"" in exchange for plus points. Our department adviser talked to us regarding such issues. He improved. However, we have not yet seen the ""change"" we were expecting. We hope that the higher ups could take action on these behaviors of ud professors, not just for us, but also for the future lasallians.",1.0

I've had professors that looked indifferent and unprepared in various disciplines, which directly hampered my ability to learn complicated ideas. Furthermore, the obsolete curriculum has become a significant impediment to our academic advancement. In today's fast-paced world, educational institutions must adjust their curriculum to stay up with industry trends and innovations. Another area of concern is the scarcity of resources and facilities for students and professors. The lack of laboratory equipment immediately impairs the educational experience and stifles our general growth and development.","Invest in professional development programs for faculty members to help them improve their teaching abilities. Moreover, the university could also organize a group of academic members, industry professionals, and students to evaluate and revise the curriculum on a regular basis. Lastly, provide funding to improve laboratory equipment. ",-1.0

That means studying the lessons because the teachers don’t bother to teach us. ,I hope the profs/teachers next sem would be more attentive to their students and would focus on actually teaching. ,1.0

And this is coming from someone who is very understanding and chill most (if not all) of the time. I think anyone who's encountered a great professor here knows just how much I wish every single professor could be like them. With the amount of tuition that we pay (which is rumoured to increase yet again), we students deserve better than what we're currently getting from our education. On facilities, just like how other people may have already suggested, I wish the library was open for longer. I'm not going to say anything about student services. If there were any issues, I'm not aware of them. ","How do you improve professor quality... I honestly don't know. As for the library, maaaaaaybe they can hire more staff to man the building all through the night? I mean if I could I would. I'd take that library night shift in a heartbeat.",-1.0
